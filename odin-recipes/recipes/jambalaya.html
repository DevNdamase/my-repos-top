        <img src="./recipe-images/jambalaya.jpg" alt="A nice Jambalaya dish shown" max-height="600px">
        <p>Jambalaya is a one-pot dish that's made with rice, meat or seafood, and vegetables. <br>
            With French and Spanish influences, jambalaya is quite similar to paella. <br>
            The name "jambalaya" likely comes from the Provençal word "jambalaia," which means mishmash.</p>
